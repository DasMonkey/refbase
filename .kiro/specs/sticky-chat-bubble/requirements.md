# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a persistent sticky chat bubble positioned in the lower right corner of the application that provides easy access to the AI chat functionality. The chat bubble will replace the current mouse-position-based trigger system with a more intuitive and accessible button-based approach, ensuring users can access AI assistance from any page or project context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a persistent chat bubble in the lower right corner of my screen, so that I can easily access AI assistance from anywhere in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a floating chat bubble in the lower right corner of the viewport
2. WHEN I navigate between different projects, tabs, or pages THEN the chat bubble SHALL remain visible and positioned consistently
3. WHEN I scroll within any page content THEN the chat bubble SHALL maintain its fixed position relative to the viewport
4. WHEN the chat bubble is displayed THEN it SHALL have a distinctive visual design that clearly indicates it's for AI chat functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the chat bubble to open the AI chat modal, so that I can interact with the AI assistant without needing to remember keyboard shortcuts or mouse positioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on the chat bubble THEN the system SHALL open the existing AI chat modal with the prompt input box
2. WHEN the AI chat modal is opened via the chat bubble THEN the prompt input box SHALL automatically receive focus
3. WHEN the AI chat modal is open THEN the chat bubble SHALL remain visible but may change appearance to indicate the active state
4. WHEN I close the AI chat modal THEN the chat bubble SHALL return to its default appearance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat bubble to replace the current mouse-position-based trigger system, so that I have a more predictable and accessible way to access AI chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat bubble feature is implemented THEN the system SHALL remove the mouse position detection logic for showing the AI chat
2. WHEN I move my mouse to the bottom of the screen THEN the AI chat modal SHALL NOT automatically appear
3. WHEN I use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd+0) THEN the AI chat modal SHALL still open and function as before
4. WHEN the chat bubble is the primary trigger THEN all existing AI chat functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat bubble to be visually appealing and non-intrusive, so that it enhances my experience without being distracting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat bubble is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate theming that matches the current dark/light mode
2. WHEN I hover over the chat bubble THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback such as a subtle animation or color change
3. WHEN the chat bubble is positioned THEN it SHALL not overlap with important UI elements or content
4. WHEN the chat bubble is sized THEN it SHALL be large enough to be easily clickable but small enough to not obstruct content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat bubble to work consistently across all application contexts, so that I can access AI help regardless of where I am in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on any project workspace tab (Dashboard, Documents, Tasks, Features, Bugs, Calendar, Files, Chat) THEN the chat bubble SHALL be visible and functional
2. WHEN I switch between different projects THEN the chat bubble SHALL maintain its position and functionality
3. WHEN the application is in different responsive states THEN the chat bubble SHALL adjust its position appropriately to remain accessible
4. WHEN there are modal dialogs or overlays open THEN the chat bubble SHALL have appropriate z-index layering to remain accessible
