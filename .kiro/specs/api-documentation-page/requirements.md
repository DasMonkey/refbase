# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive API documentation page for RefBase that displays existing markdown documentation files in a modern SaaS-style layout. The documentation page will provide users with easy access to API guides, configuration instructions, and technical documentation through an intuitive sidebar navigation and content display system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a RefBase user, I want to access comprehensive API documentation through a dedicated documentation page, so that I can understand how to integrate and use RefBase's features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "View Docs" button in the API Keys settings popup THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated documentation page
2. WHEN the documentation page loads THEN the system SHALL display a modern SaaS-style layout with sidebar navigation and main content area
3. WHEN the documentation page is accessed THEN the system SHALL automatically load and display available documentation from the docs/ folder

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to browse different documentation sections through a sidebar navigation, so that I can quickly find the specific information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation page loads THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with a list of all available documentation files
2. WHEN a user clicks on a documentation item in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL load and display that document's content in the main content area
3. WHEN a documentation item is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the active item in the sidebar navigation
4. WHEN the sidebar contains multiple documentation files THEN the system SHALL organize them in a logical order (API, Configuration, Examples, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading documentation, I want the markdown content to be properly formatted and styled, so that I can easily read and understand the technical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN markdown content is displayed THEN the system SHALL render all markdown formatting including headers, code blocks, lists, and links
2. WHEN code blocks are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting appropriate to the language
3. WHEN the content is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply consistent typography and spacing that matches RefBase's design system
4. WHEN links are present in the documentation THEN the system SHALL handle both internal and external links appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the documentation page to be responsive and accessible on different screen sizes, so that I can read documentation on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation page is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a collapsible sidebar navigation
2. WHEN viewed on small screens THEN the system SHALL stack the sidebar and content vertically for optimal readability
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle button to show/hide the navigation
4. WHEN content is displayed on any screen size THEN the system SHALL maintain proper text readability and spacing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a RefBase administrator, I want the documentation system to automatically detect and include new documentation files, so that I can add new docs without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new markdown files are added to the docs/ folder THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the sidebar navigation
2. WHEN documentation files are removed from the docs/ folder THEN the system SHALL automatically remove them from the navigation
3. WHEN the documentation page loads THEN the system SHALL scan the docs/ directory and build the navigation dynamically
4. IF a documentation file cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and continue loading other files
