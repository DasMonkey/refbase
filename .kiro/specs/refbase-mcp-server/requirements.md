# RefBase MCP Server Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RefBase MCP Server provides MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that enable AI assistants in IDEs to interact with the RefBase webapp. The server exposes explicit tools that AI can call to save conversations, search for bugs/features, and retrieve project context from the RefBase knowledge base.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Exposes MCP tools to IDEs (Cursor, Claude Code, Kiro) via MCP protocol
- Integrates with existing RefBase webapp API endpoints
- Uses token-based authentication for secure access
- Provides bidirectional flow: Save data to RefBase AND search existing knowledge
- Maintains user context and project awareness
