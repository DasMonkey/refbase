# Implementation Plan - RefBase MCP Server

Convert the RefBase MCP Server design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage.
