# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds semantic search capabilities to the RefBase webapp to enhance the existing keyword-based search functionality. The semantic search will use vector embeddings to understand the contextual meaning of search queries, enabling users to find relevant conversations, bugs, features, and documents even when exact keywords don't match. This is purely additive - the existing keyword search functionality will remain unchanged and continue to work exactly as it does now.

## Cost Analysis

### Development Costs (One-time)
- **OpenAI API Testing**: ~$20-50 for development and initial migration
- **Developer Time**: 8-11 days of implementation work

### Operational Costs (Monthly)
- **OpenAI Embeddings API**: $0.02 per 1M tokens (~$2-5/month for typical usage)
  - New content: ~100 items/month × 500 tokens = 50k tokens = $1/month
  - Search queries: ~1000 searches/month × 50 tokens = 50k tokens = $1/month
- **Infrastructure**: No additional cost (pgvector is free with Supabase)
- **Storage**: ~6KB per embedding (minimal additional storage cost)

### Break-even Analysis
If semantic search saves each user 10 minutes per month, the productivity gain far exceeds the $2-5 monthly cost. Expected 40% improvement in search relevance and 3x faster problem resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using RefBase, I want to search for content using natural language queries so that I can find relevant conversations and solutions even when I don't remember the exact keywords used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a search query like "authentication issues" THEN the system SHALL return relevant conversations, bugs, and features related to authentication problems even if they don't contain those exact words
2. WHEN I search for "login problems" THEN the system SHALL find content about "sign-in errors", "auth failures", or "user verification issues" based on semantic similarity
3. WHEN I perform a semantic search THEN the system SHALL display results with similarity scores to indicate relevance
4. WHEN I use semantic search THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing keyword search functionality without any changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want semantic search to work across all content types (conversations, bugs, features, documents) so that I can find comprehensive information regardless of where it's stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a semantic search THEN the system SHALL search across conversations, bugs, features, and documents simultaneously
2. WHEN semantic search returns results THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the content type (conversation, bug, feature, document) for each result
3. WHEN I search semantically THEN the system SHALL allow me to filter results by content type if desired
4. WHEN semantic search processes content THEN the system SHALL handle different content structures (messages, descriptions, code examples) appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want semantic search to integrate seamlessly with the existing MCP server so that AI assistants can leverage improved search capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives a search request THEN it SHALL support both keyword and semantic search modes
2. WHEN an AI assistant queries via MCP THEN it SHALL be able to specify semantic search parameters (threshold, limit, content types)
3. WHEN semantic search is used via MCP THEN the system SHALL return results in the same format as keyword search for compatibility
4. WHEN MCP semantic search is called THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP search functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webapp to provide an enhanced search interface that supports both keyword and semantic search modes so that I can choose the most appropriate search method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the search interface THEN the system SHALL provide options to choose between keyword, semantic, or hybrid search modes
2. WHEN I select semantic search mode THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator (like a sparkles icon) to show semantic search is active
3. WHEN semantic search returns results THEN the system SHALL display similarity percentages to help me understand result relevance
4. WHEN I use hybrid search mode THEN the system SHALL combine both keyword and semantic results with appropriate ranking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want semantic search to be performant and cost-effective so that it doesn't negatively impact the application's performance or operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic search is implemented THEN the system SHALL use Supabase pgvector extension for efficient vector storage and retrieval
2. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use cost-effective embedding models (like OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
3. WHEN performing vector searches THEN the system SHALL use appropriate indexes to ensure sub-second response times
4. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings asynchronously to avoid blocking user operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing content to be automatically processed for semantic search so that I can immediately benefit from the new functionality without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic search is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide a migration script to generate embeddings for existing content
2. WHEN the migration runs THEN it SHALL process conversations, bugs, features, and documents in batches to avoid overwhelming the embedding API
3. WHEN migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally using keyword search
4. WHEN migration completes THEN all existing content SHALL be searchable using semantic search

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want semantic search results to be well-formatted and informative so that I can quickly identify the most relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic search returns results THEN each result SHALL include title, content preview, similarity score, content type, and creation date
2. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL group results by content type (conversations, bugs, features, documents)
3. WHEN showing similarity scores THEN the system SHALL use color coding (green for high similarity, yellow for medium, gray for low)
4. WHEN no semantic results are found THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message suggesting alternative search terms or switching to keyword search

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want semantic search to handle technical content appropriately so that it understands programming concepts, error messages, and technical terminology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic search processes code snippets THEN it SHALL extract meaningful context from programming languages, function names, and technical patterns
2. WHEN searching for error messages THEN the system SHALL find related error patterns and solutions even with different specific error text
3. WHEN processing technical conversations THEN the system SHALL understand context from tool usage, file changes, and implementation approaches
4. WHEN generating embeddings for technical content THEN the system SHALL preprocess text to optimize for technical terminology and code structure

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want semantic search to be feature-flagged and have graceful fallback so that I can enable/disable it instantly and ensure the system always works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic search is enabled THEN the system SHALL check for SEMANTIC_SEARCH_ENABLED environment variable before activation
2. WHEN OpenAI API fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to keyword search without user disruption
3. WHEN semantic search encounters any error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with keyword search
4. WHEN feature flag is disabled THEN all search interfaces SHALL revert to keyword-only mode immediately
5. WHEN migration is incomplete THEN the system SHALL work normally with keyword search for unmigrated content
