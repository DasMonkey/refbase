# Design Document

## Overview

The calendar improvements will enhance the existing CalendarTab component by implementing proper event persistence, consolidating the user interface, and adding an upcoming events section. The design maintains the current visual style while fixing functionality issues and improving user experience.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
- **CalendarTab**: Main container component (existing, to be enhanced)
- **EventModal**: Event creation/editing modal (existing, to be enhanced)
- **UpcomingEvents**: New component for displaying upcoming events
- **EventStorage**: New utility service for event persistence

### Data Flow
1. Events are stored in localStorage with project-specific keys
2. CalendarTab manages event state using React hooks
3. Event operations (CRUD) go through EventStorage service
4. Real-time updates reflect immediately in both calendar and upcoming events

## Components and Interfaces

### Event Data Model
```typescript
interface CalendarEvent {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  date: Date;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  type: 'meeting' | 'task' | 'milestone' | 'bug';
  attendees?: string[];
  projectId: string;
}
```

### EventStorage Service
```typescript
interface EventStorage {
  getEvents(projectId: string): CalendarEvent[];
  saveEvent(event: CalendarEvent): void;
  updateEvent(eventId: string, updates: Partial<CalendarEvent>): void;
  deleteEvent(eventId: string, projectId: string): void;
  getUpcomingEvents(projectId: string, days: number): CalendarEvent[];
}
```

### UpcomingEvents Component
- Displays events for the next 7 days
- Shows event title, date, time, and type
- Allows clicking to navigate to event date
- Handles empty state when no upcoming events exist

## Data Models

### Event Storage Schema
Events will be stored in localStorage using the key pattern: `calendar_events_${projectId}`

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "title": "Team Standup",
      "description": "Daily team sync meeting",
      "date": "2025-08-20T00:00:00.000Z",
      "startTime": "09:00",
      "endTime": "09:30",
      "type": "meeting",
      "attendees": ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"],
      "projectId": "project-123"
    }
  ]
}
```

### State Management
- Use React useState for current events array
- Use useEffect to load events on component mount
- Implement custom hooks for event operations

## User Interface Changes

### Single Add Event Button
- Remove the duplicate "Add Event" buttons from the empty state and events header
- Keep only the primary "Add Event" button in the calendar header
- Style consistently with existing design patterns

### Upcoming Events Section
- Position below the calendar grid in the left sidebar
- Use similar styling to existing event cards
- Show maximum 5 upcoming events with "View All" option if more exist
- Include event type indicators and time information

### Enhanced Event Modal
- Add proper form validation
- Implement actual save/update functionality
- Show loading states during operations
- Display success/error feedback

## Error Handling

### Storage Errors
- Handle localStorage quota exceeded gracefully
- Provide fallback to in-memory storage if localStorage fails
- Show user-friendly error messages for storage issues

### Validation Errors
- Validate required fields (title, date, start time, end time)
- Ensure end time is after start time
- Validate date format and prevent past dates for new events
- Show inline validation messages

### Data Consistency
- Handle malformed data in localStorage gracefully
- Provide data migration for schema changes
- Validate event data on load and filter invalid entries

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- EventStorage service methods (CRUD operations)
- Event validation functions
- Date/time utility functions
- UpcomingEvents component rendering

### Integration Tests
- Event creation flow from modal to storage
- Calendar navigation with event persistence
- Upcoming events synchronization with main calendar

### User Acceptance Tests
- Create, edit, and delete events successfully
- Verify events persist across page refreshes
- Confirm upcoming events display correctly
- Test single "Add Event" button functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Storage Optimization
- Implement event cleanup for old events (older than 1 year)
- Use efficient JSON serialization/deserialization
- Consider pagination for projects with many events

### Rendering Optimization
- Memoize event calculations for calendar days
- Use React.memo for UpcomingEvents component
- Optimize re-renders when events change

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure modal can be navigated with keyboard
- Add proper focus management for event creation flow
- Support arrow key navigation in calendar grid

### Screen Reader Support
- Add appropriate ARIA labels for calendar events
- Provide descriptive text for event type indicators
- Ensure upcoming events section is properly announced

## Migration Strategy

### Existing Mock Data
- Preserve existing mock events during development
- Provide option to import mock events into storage
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing event structure

### Gradual Rollout
- Implement storage layer first without UI changes
- Add upcoming events section as enhancement
- Consolidate UI elements in final phase
