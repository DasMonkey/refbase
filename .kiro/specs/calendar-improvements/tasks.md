# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create event storage service and utilities




  - Create EventStorage service class with CRUD operations for calendar events
  - Implement localStorage-based persistence with project-specific keys
  - Add event validation functions and data sanitization
  - Write unit tests for storage operations and validation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.4_

- [x] 2. Implement proper event state management in CalendarTab



  - Replace mock events with real state management using useState and useEffect
  - Create custom hooks for event operations (useEvents, useEventOperations)
  - Implement event loading on component mount with error handling
  - Add event state synchronization across calendar and event list views
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Fix event creation and editing functionality


  - Implement actual save functionality in the event modal form
  - Add form validation with error messages for required fields and time validation
  - Create event update functionality that modifies existing events
  - Add loading states and success/error feedback for event operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5.3, 5.5_

- [x] 4. Implement event deletion functionality


  - Add delete event functionality to remove events from storage
  - Update calendar display immediately after deletion
  - Add confirmation dialog for event deletion to prevent accidental removal
  - Handle delete operations with proper error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Consolidate Add Event button interface


  - Remove duplicate "Add Event" buttons from empty state and events header
  - Keep only the primary "Add Event" button in the calendar header section
  - Ensure the single button works consistently across all calendar states
  - Update button styling to match existing design patterns
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Create UpcomingEvents component


  - Build new UpcomingEvents component to display next 7 days of events
  - Implement event filtering logic to show only future events in chronological order
  - Add click handlers to navigate to event dates when upcoming events are clicked
  - Style component to match existing calendar event cards design
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Integrate UpcomingEvents into CalendarTab layout


  - Add UpcomingEvents component below the calendar grid in the left sidebar
  - Implement proper responsive layout that works with existing calendar structure
  - Add empty state handling when no upcoming events exist
  - Ensure upcoming events update when calendar events change
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and validation

  - Implement localStorage error handling with fallback to in-memory storage
  - Add form validation for event creation with inline error messages
  - Handle malformed data in localStorage gracefully with data cleanup
  - Add user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Write comprehensive tests for calendar functionality

  - Create unit tests for EventStorage service methods and validation functions
  - Write integration tests for event creation, editing, and deletion flows
  - Add tests for UpcomingEvents component rendering and interaction
  - Test event persistence across page refreshes and browser sessions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 10. Optimize performance and add final polish



  - Implement React.memo for UpcomingEvents component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Add event cleanup functionality for old events to manage storage size
  - Optimize calendar day calculations and event filtering for better performance
  - Add proper TypeScript types and ensure type safety throughout the implementation
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_
