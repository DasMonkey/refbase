# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the calendar tab functionality by fixing the broken event creation system, consolidating multiple "Add Event" buttons into a single consistent interface, and adding an upcoming events section below the calendar view. The improvements will provide users with a more intuitive and functional calendar experience within the project management workspace.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully create and save calendar events so that I can track my scheduled activities and meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Add Event" button THEN the system SHALL open an event creation modal with all necessary fields
2. WHEN I fill out the event form and click "Add Event" or "Update Event" THEN the system SHALL save the event data and display it on the calendar
3. WHEN I create an event THEN the system SHALL close the modal and show the new event on the selected date
4. WHEN I edit an existing event THEN the system SHALL update the event data and reflect changes immediately
5. WHEN I delete an event THEN the system SHALL remove it from the calendar and update the display

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single, consistent "Add Event" button so that the interface is not confusing and cluttered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the calendar tab THEN the system SHALL display only one "Add Event" button in the header area
2. WHEN I click the "Add Event" button THEN the system SHALL open the event creation modal with the currently selected date pre-filled
3. WHEN there are no events on a selected date THEN the system SHALL NOT display an additional "Add Event" button in the empty state
4. WHEN I want to create an event THEN the system SHALL provide a clear and accessible way to do so from the main interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see upcoming events in a dedicated section so that I can quickly view what's coming up without navigating through the calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the calendar tab THEN the system SHALL display an "Upcoming Events" section below the calendar view
2. WHEN there are events in the next 7 days THEN the system SHALL show them in chronological order in the upcoming events section
3. WHEN I click on an upcoming event THEN the system SHALL navigate to that event's date and highlight the event
4. WHEN there are no upcoming events THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. WHEN an event is today or in the past THEN the system SHALL NOT include it in the upcoming events section

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper event persistence so that my calendar events are maintained across sessions and page refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an event THEN the system SHALL store it in a way that persists across browser sessions
2. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL load and display all previously created events
3. WHEN I modify an event THEN the system SHALL update the stored data immediately
4. WHEN I delete an event THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage permanently
5. IF the system uses local storage THEN the system SHALL handle storage limits gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved event management functionality so that I can efficiently organize my calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view an event THEN the system SHALL display all event details including title, time, type, description, and attendees
2. WHEN I edit an event THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the form with existing event data
3. WHEN I create an event with invalid data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate validation messages
4. WHEN I create an event THEN the system SHALL generate a unique identifier for tracking
5. WHEN events overlap in time THEN the system SHALL display them in a way that shows the conflict
