# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive Mermaid diagram support to RefBase's markdown editor and preview system. Mermaid diagrams will enhance the visual documentation capabilities of the platform, allowing teams to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams, and other visual representations directly within their feature specifications, documents, and AI conversation analysis.

The integration will support all major Mermaid diagram types with proper theming, responsive design, and seamless integration with the existing markdown editor infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and view Mermaid diagrams in markdown documents, so that I can visually document system architecture and processes alongside text content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user writes a code block with language "mermaid" THEN the system SHALL render it as a visual diagram instead of syntax-highlighted code
2. WHEN the user switches between dark and light themes THEN the Mermaid diagrams SHALL automatically update to match the current theme
3. WHEN a Mermaid diagram fails to render due to syntax errors THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message and fallback to showing the raw code
4. WHEN viewing a document with Mermaid diagrams THEN the diagrams SHALL be responsive and scale appropriately on different screen sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to copy Mermaid diagram source code, so that I can reuse and share diagram definitions across different documents and projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a rendered Mermaid diagram THEN the system SHALL display a copy button
2. WHEN the copy button is clicked THEN the system SHALL copy the raw Mermaid source code to the clipboard
3. WHEN the copy operation completes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the successful copy
4. WHEN copying fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want Mermaid to be available as a language option in the editor, so that I can easily create new diagrams with proper syntax highlighting and auto-completion hints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the language selector in the enhanced editor THEN "Mermaid" SHALL appear as an available language option
2. WHEN a user selects Mermaid as the language THEN the editor SHALL provide appropriate file extensions (.mmd, .mermaid)
3. WHEN editing Mermaid code THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for Mermaid syntax
4. WHEN a file has .mmd or .mermaid extension THEN the system SHALL automatically detect it as Mermaid content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all major Mermaid diagram types to be supported, so that I can create comprehensive visual documentation for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating diagrams THEN the system SHALL support flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, user journey diagrams, Gantt charts, pie charts, and Git graphs
2. WHEN rendering complex diagrams THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with render times under 100ms for typical diagrams
3. WHEN diagrams contain interactive elements THEN the system SHALL preserve Mermaid's built-in interactivity features
4. WHEN diagrams are too large for the container THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate scrolling or zoom controls

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want Mermaid diagrams to be rendered safely, so that malicious content cannot execute scripts or compromise the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering Mermaid diagrams THEN the system SHALL disable script execution and use strict security settings
2. WHEN processing diagram content THEN the system SHALL sanitize input to prevent XSS attacks
3. WHEN diagrams contain external references THEN the system SHALL validate and restrict access to approved domains only
4. WHEN security validation fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to displaying the raw code with a security warning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want Mermaid diagrams to load efficiently, so that they don't impact the overall application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the Mermaid library SHALL be lazy-loaded only when needed
2. WHEN multiple diagrams are present THEN the system SHALL implement diagram caching for unchanged content
3. WHEN diagrams are being edited THEN the system SHALL debounce re-rendering to prevent excessive updates
4. WHEN components unmount THEN the system SHALL properly clean up Mermaid instances to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an accessibility-focused user, I want Mermaid diagrams to be accessible, so that all team members can understand the visual content regardless of their abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagrams are rendered THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alt text for screen readers
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboards THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation of interactive diagram elements
3. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN the diagrams SHALL maintain readability and contrast requirements
4. WHEN diagrams cannot be rendered THEN the system SHALL provide the raw text as an accessible fallback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a RefBase user, I want Mermaid diagrams to integrate seamlessly with existing features, so that I can use them in all document types and contexts where markdown is supported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating feature specifications THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL be available in the enhanced editor
2. WHEN viewing documents in split-view mode THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL render correctly in both preview and edit modes
3. WHEN saving documents with Mermaid content THEN the system SHALL preserve the diagram source code accurately
4. WHEN searching content THEN the system SHALL index Mermaid diagram text content for search functionality
