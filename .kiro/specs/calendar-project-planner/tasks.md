## Migration Notes

**Completed Tasks (1-5)**: These tasks from the original calendar-based approach are still valid and completed. The database schema, hooks, navigation, and modal components work perfectly with the new timeline approach.

**Replaced Tasks**: 
- Original tasks 6-12 (calendar grid, timeline bars, integration) are replaced with new tasks 6-20 that implement the horizontal timeline approach
- The new approach provides much better scalability and user experience for project planning

**Key Improvements**:
- Unlimited tracker capacity (no stacking limitations)
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Better visual planning capabilities
- Notion Calendar-inspired UX
- Enhanced accessibility and keyboard navigation
