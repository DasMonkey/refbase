# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Calendar tab to include a project planning mode that displays timeline bars for projects, features, and bugs with start and end dates. The enhancement adds visual project management capabilities while preserving all existing calendar functionality through a sub-tab interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to switch between calendar view and project planner view within the Calendar tab, so that I can access both event scheduling and project timeline management in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the Calendar tab THEN I SHALL see sub-tabs for "Calendar" and "Project Planner" modes
2. WHEN I click the "Calendar" sub-tab THEN the system SHALL display the existing calendar functionality unchanged
3. WHEN I click the "Project Planner" sub-tab THEN the system SHALL display the project timeline view
4. WHEN I switch between sub-tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the current month/date context
5. IF no sub-tab is explicitly selected THEN the system SHALL default to the "Calendar" view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create project trackers with start and end dates, so that I can visually plan and track project timelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in Project Planner mode THEN I SHALL see an "Add Tracker" button
2. WHEN I click "Add Tracker" THEN the system SHALL open a modal to create a new project tracker
3. WHEN creating a tracker THEN I SHALL be able to specify title, type (Project/Feature/Bug), start date, and end date
4. WHEN I save a tracker THEN the system SHALL validate that end date is after start date
5. WHEN I save a valid tracker THEN the system SHALL add it to the database and display it immediately
6. IF the tracker spans multiple days THEN the system SHALL display it as a continuous bar across those days

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to see project trackers displayed as colored bars on the calendar, so that I can quickly understand project timelines and overlaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Project Planner THEN I SHALL see a calendar grid with timeline bars overlaid
2. WHEN a tracker spans one day THEN the system SHALL display it as a colored block for that day
3. WHEN a tracker spans multiple days THEN the system SHALL display it as a continuous colored bar across all days
4. WHEN multiple trackers exist on the same day THEN the system SHALL stack them vertically without overlap
5. WHEN trackers have different types THEN the system SHALL use different colors (Projects: blue, Features: green, Bugs: red)
6. WHEN a tracker bar is too narrow for text THEN the system SHALL show abbreviated text or just the color

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to click on project tracker bars to view details, so that I can quickly access project information and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a tracker bar THEN the system SHALL display a details popup or sidebar
2. WHEN the details view opens THEN I SHALL see tracker title, type, start date, end date, and description
3. WHEN viewing tracker details THEN I SHALL have options to edit or delete the tracker
4. WHEN I edit a tracker THEN the system SHALL update the timeline display immediately
5. WHEN I delete a tracker THEN the system SHALL remove it from the display and database
6. WHEN I click outside the details view THEN the system SHALL close the details popup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to navigate between months in Project Planner mode, so that I can view project timelines across different time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in Project Planner mode THEN I SHALL see month navigation controls (previous/next)
2. WHEN I navigate to a different month THEN the system SHALL display trackers that overlap with that month
3. WHEN a tracker spans across month boundaries THEN the system SHALL show the appropriate portion in each month
4. WHEN I switch back to Calendar mode THEN the system SHALL maintain the same month context
5. WHEN I navigate months THEN the system SHALL preserve any selected tracker details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want project trackers to integrate with existing project data, so that I can link trackers to actual tasks, features, and bugs in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a tracker THEN I SHALL be able to optionally link it to existing tasks, features, or bugs
2. WHEN a tracker is linked to project items THEN the system SHALL display connection indicators
3. WHEN I click on a linked tracker THEN I SHALL have options to navigate to the linked items
4. WHEN linked project items are updated THEN the system SHALL reflect status changes in the tracker display
5. WHEN I delete a linked project item THEN the system SHALL either unlink or prompt about the tracker

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the Project Planner to maintain the existing design consistency, so that the interface feels cohesive with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Project Planner THEN it SHALL use the same color scheme and typography as the existing calendar
2. WHEN I interact with Project Planner elements THEN they SHALL follow the same hover and click behaviors as existing UI
3. WHEN modals or popups appear THEN they SHALL match the existing modal design patterns
4. WHEN displaying tracker bars THEN they SHALL use colors that complement the existing theme
5. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN the Project Planner SHALL adapt accordingly
