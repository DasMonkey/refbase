# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature redesigns the existing tasks tab kanban board to improve usability and visual design. The current implementation has cards that are too wide, stretch across the full width, and limit text input to only 2 lines. The redesign will create a more compact, post-it note style interface with better editing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user managing tasks, I want kanban cards to be more compact and square-shaped, so that I can see more cards at once and have a cleaner visual layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN each card SHALL have a square or near-square aspect ratio
2. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN cards SHALL NOT stretch across the full column width
3. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN cards SHALL have no rounded corners to mimic post-it notes
4. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN cards SHALL use a post-it note style background color (yellow/cream tone)
5. WHEN viewing multiple cards THEN the layout SHALL allow more cards to be visible in the viewport

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user creating or editing tasks, I want to be able to input more than 2 lines of text, so that I can provide adequate task descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a task card THEN the text input SHALL support multiple lines of text
2. WHEN typing in a task card THEN the text SHALL wrap naturally without being limited to 2 lines
3. WHEN a task has long text THEN the card SHALL expand vertically to accommodate the content
4. WHEN viewing a card with long text THEN all text SHALL be visible without truncation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing tasks, I want an edit button on each card, so that I can easily modify task content without complex interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a task card THEN there SHALL be a pencil/edit icon button visible on the right side
2. WHEN clicking the edit button THEN the card SHALL enter edit mode
3. WHEN in edit mode THEN the user SHALL be able to modify the task text
4. WHEN finishing editing THEN the user SHALL be able to save changes with a clear action
5. WHEN finishing editing THEN the user SHALL be able to cancel changes and revert to original text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with the kanban board, I want the visual design to be consistent with post-it note aesthetics, so that the interface feels familiar and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing task cards THEN they SHALL have a post-it note yellow/cream background color
2. WHEN viewing task cards THEN they SHALL have sharp corners (no border-radius)
3. WHEN viewing task cards THEN they SHALL have subtle shadows to create depth like physical post-it notes
4. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN the overall layout SHALL maintain the existing drag-and-drop functionality
5. WHEN viewing task cards THEN the text SHALL be dark colored for good contrast against the light background

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple tasks, I want the kanban columns to have appropriate spacing and sizing, so that the board is easy to navigate and use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN columns SHALL have consistent spacing between them
2. WHEN viewing the kanban board THEN each column SHALL have an appropriate fixed or maximum width
3. WHEN viewing cards within columns THEN there SHALL be adequate spacing between cards
4. WHEN the board contains many cards THEN the layout SHALL remain organized and scannable
5. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN the board SHALL maintain usability across different screen sizes
