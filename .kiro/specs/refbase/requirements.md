# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RefBase is an intelligent development knowledge base that extends an existing project management webapp with AI conversation capture and learning capabilities using a **phased development approach**.

**Foundation webapp** already provides: project management, task tracking, bug reporting, document management, team chat, file management, and calendar features.

**RefBase enhancement strategy:**
- **Phase 1 Priority**: Build core webapp with manual conversation import and pattern recognition
- **Phase 2**: Add MCP server integration for automated IDE capture (after Phase 1 success)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced AI learning loop with context feeding (after MCP proven)

This phased approach ensures rapid value delivery while building toward the full vision. The architecture is designed from day 1 to seamlessly support MCP integration without requiring major refactoring.

**Key principle**: Prove the core concept with manual input before investing in complex automation.

## Phased Requirements
