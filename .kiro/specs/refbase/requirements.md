# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RefBase is a webapp/MCP server that integrates with IDEs like Cursor and Claude Code to export and process chat history, creating a comprehensive reference database for developers. The system helps "vibe coders" manage bug reports, track successful implementations, and reduce mistakes by learning from previous coding sessions. It serves as an intelligent knowledge base that grows with each development session, accessible at refbase.dev.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Chat History Export and Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using an AI-powered IDE, I want to seamlessly export my chat history without leaving my development environment, so that I can build a comprehensive reference database of my coding sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects the MCP server to their IDE THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection with Cursor, Claude Code, and other compatible IDEs
2. WHEN a user initiates chat history export THEN the system SHALL extract complete conversation threads including code snippets, explanations, and context
3. WHEN chat history is exported THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting, timestamps, and conversation flow
4. WHEN multiple IDE sessions are active THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent exports without data loss
5. IF an export fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and provide clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Document Processing and Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my chat history to be automatically processed and organized into meaningful documents and categories, so that I can easily find relevant information for future projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chat history is imported THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize conversations by topic (bug fixes, feature implementations, debugging, etc.)
2. WHEN processing conversations THEN the system SHALL extract code snippets, solutions, and implementation patterns
3. WHEN creating documents THEN the system SHALL generate structured summaries with key insights and learnings
4. WHEN similar topics are detected THEN the system SHALL link related conversations and create cross-references
5. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual categorization and retry processing

### Requirement 3: Reference Database and Search

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search through my accumulated coding knowledge and find relevant solutions from previous implementations, so that I can avoid repeating mistakes and build upon successful patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches the database THEN the system SHALL provide relevant results based on keywords, code patterns, and context
2. WHEN viewing search results THEN the system SHALL display original conversations, extracted solutions, and related implementations
3. WHEN a user queries about a specific technology or problem THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant past solutions and patterns
4. WHEN browsing the database THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by date, project, technology stack, and success rating
5. IF no relevant results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest similar topics and allow expanding search criteria

### Requirement 4: Bug Report Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create, track, and manage bug reports with context from my AI conversations, so that I can systematically address issues and learn from resolution patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a bug report THEN the system SHALL allow linking to relevant chat conversations and code snippets
2. WHEN a bug is reported THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest similar past issues and their resolutions
3. WHEN updating bug status THEN the system SHALL track resolution steps and successful solutions
4. WHEN a bug is resolved THEN the system SHALL extract the solution pattern for future reference
5. IF a bug recurs THEN the system SHALL highlight previous occurrences and attempted solutions

### Requirement 5: Feature Implementation Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track feature implementations with their associated AI conversations and outcomes, so that I can replicate successful approaches and avoid failed patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a feature THEN the system SHALL allow creating feature records linked to relevant conversations
2. WHEN a feature is completed THEN the system SHALL capture the implementation approach, challenges, and solutions
3. WHEN planning new features THEN the system SHALL suggest similar past implementations and their success patterns
4. WHEN reviewing features THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on implementation time, complexity, and success rate
5. IF a feature implementation fails THEN the system SHALL document the failure reasons and lessons learned

### Requirement 6: Pattern Recognition and Learning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to learn from my coding patterns and provide intelligent suggestions, so that I can improve my development efficiency and code quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing conversations THEN the system SHALL identify recurring patterns in problem-solving approaches
2. WHEN a user encounters a similar problem THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest relevant past solutions
3. WHEN code patterns are successful THEN the system SHALL promote them as recommended approaches
4. WHEN anti-patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest alternatives
5. IF learning confidence is low THEN the system SHALL request user feedback to improve recommendations

### Requirement 7: Project Context and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer working on multiple projects, I want to organize my reference database by project context, so that I can find project-specific solutions and maintain clean separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing chat history THEN the system SHALL detect and assign project context based on file paths and conversation content
2. WHEN creating entries THEN the system SHALL allow manual project assignment and tagging
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL provide project-specific filtering and scoping options
4. WHEN switching projects THEN the system SHALL prioritize relevant context while maintaining access to cross-project patterns
5. IF project context is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL prompt for clarification and learn from user input

### Requirement 8: Collaboration and Sharing

**User Story:** As a developer working in a team, I want to share selected knowledge and patterns with my teammates, so that we can collectively build better software and learn from each other's experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to share knowledge THEN the system SHALL allow exporting selected conversations and patterns
2. WHEN sharing with team members THEN the system SHALL provide privacy controls and selective sharing options
3. WHEN receiving shared knowledge THEN the system SHALL integrate it into the personal database with proper attribution
4. WHEN collaborating THEN the system SHALL support team-wide pattern libraries and best practices
5. IF sharing conflicts with privacy THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive information while preserving learning value

### Requirement 9: Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see analytics about my coding patterns, productivity trends, and learning progress, so that I can identify areas for improvement and track my growth over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display coding session frequency, problem types, and resolution success rates
2. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL identify productivity patterns and suggest optimization opportunities
3. WHEN reviewing progress THEN the system SHALL show skill development in different technologies and problem domains
4. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL highlight improvements and areas needing attention
5. IF data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on building more comprehensive tracking

### Requirement 10: Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer using various tools and workflows, I want the system to integrate with my existing development ecosystem, so that it becomes a seamless part of my development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with development tools THEN the system SHALL support popular IDEs, version control systems, and project management tools
