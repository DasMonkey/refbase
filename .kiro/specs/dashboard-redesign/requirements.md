# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current dashboard tab content has poor color design that doesn't fit with the webapp's overall style and theme system. This feature will redesign the dashboard to use consistent colors, proper theme support, and maintain the existing functional elements (total tasks, total bugs, total features, recent activity, quick actions) while improving the visual design and user experience. The redesigned dashboard must be project-specific, showing data only for the currently selected project, and support both dark and light modes seamlessly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to have consistent colors and styling that matches the rest of the webapp, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the color scheme SHALL match the webapp's established design system
2. WHEN switching between dark and light modes THEN all dashboard elements SHALL adapt appropriately with proper contrast
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the styling SHALL be consistent with other tabs like TasksTab, BugsTab, etc.
4. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the hover states SHALL use consistent color patterns from the theme system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see key project metrics (tasks, bugs, features, documents) in an organized and visually appealing way, so that I can quickly understand my project's status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN it SHALL display total tasks, completed tasks, total bugs, and total features for the selected project
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN each metric card SHALL show the current count and relevant progress indicators
3. WHEN viewing metric cards THEN they SHALL use appropriate icons and color coding for different data types
4. WHEN no data exists for a metric THEN it SHALL display zero with appropriate empty state messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see recent activity for the current project, so that I can stay updated on what has been happening recently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN it SHALL show the 5 most recent activities (tasks, bugs, documents) for the current project only
2. WHEN displaying recent activity THEN each item SHALL show the title, type, status, and timestamp
3. WHEN no recent activity exists THEN it SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN viewing activity items THEN they SHALL be sorted by most recent first

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want quick action buttons to create new items, so that I can efficiently start new work without navigating to other tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN it SHALL provide quick action buttons for creating tasks, reporting bugs, and creating documents
2. WHEN clicking a quick action button THEN it SHALL trigger the appropriate creation flow
3. WHEN hovering over quick action buttons THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback with consistent styling
4. WHEN viewing quick actions THEN they SHALL use appropriate icons and colors for each action type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, so that I can use it effectively on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard on desktop THEN it SHALL use a multi-column grid layout for optimal space usage
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard on mobile/tablet THEN it SHALL stack elements vertically with appropriate spacing
3. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN the dashboard SHALL adapt smoothly without breaking layout
4. WHEN viewing on any screen size THEN text SHALL remain readable and interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations and transitions in the dashboard, so that the interface feels modern and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN elements SHALL animate in with staggered timing for visual appeal
2. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL have smooth transition effects
3. WHEN data updates THEN progress bars and counters SHALL animate to their new values
4. WHEN animations play THEN they SHALL not interfere with usability or accessibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to show project progress information, so that I can understand how much work is completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN it SHALL display overall project completion percentage based on completed tasks
2. WHEN viewing project progress THEN it SHALL show completed vs remaining tasks with visual indicators
3. WHEN viewing progress section THEN it SHALL include high priority tasks and open bugs counts
4. WHEN no tasks exist THEN the progress section SHALL show appropriate messaging about getting started
