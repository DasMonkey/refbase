# RefBase Product Overview

RefBase is an intelligent AI Learning Loop system that extends an existing project management webapp with AI conversation capture and pattern recognition capabilities. The foundation webapp already provides comprehensive project management features including task tracking, bug reporting, document management, team chat, file management, and calendar functionality.

RefBase adds AI conversation integration with IDEs like Kiro, Cursor, and Claude Code to automatically capture, process, and organize coding conversations, creating a learning loop that improves AI performance over time.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Capture**: Every AI conversation with full context
- **Analyze**: Patterns and extract reusable solutions  
- **Organize**: By project, topic, and success patterns
- **Share**: Team knowledge and best practices
- **Learn**: From coding journey to suggest better approaches

## Foundation Webapp Features (Already Implemented)
- **Smart Project Management**: Multi-project workspace with Discord-style navigation
- **Task Management**: Kanban boards with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Bug Tracking**: Comprehensive bug reporting with status and severity management
- **Document Management**: Document creation, editing, and organization

## Target Users
- Development teams already using project management tools who want to enhance them with AI learning capabilities
- Individual developers using AI-powered IDEs who want to capture and reuse successful patterns
- Engineering teams looking to build institutional knowledge from AI conversations
- Organizations wanting to improve AI assistant performance through learning loops

## Integration Approach
RefBase enhances the existing project management webapp by adding AI conversation capture and learning capabilities, rather than replacing existing functionality. The system builds upon the current task management, bug tracking, and team collaboration features.
