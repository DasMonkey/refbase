# RefBase MCP Server Integration Plan
*A Complete Guide for Vibe Coders*

## What This Document Is About

This is your complete roadmap for creating a **RefBase MCP Server** - a bridge that connects your IDE (like Cursor) directly to your RefBase account. Think of it as a smart assistant that:

- **Automatically saves** your AI conversations to the right project
- **Remembers** what worked before and suggests it when you need help
- **Learns** from your patterns and gets smarter over time
- **Connects** your coding sessions with your project knowledge base

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### The Big Picture
```
Your IDE (Cursor) ‚Üî MCP Server ‚Üî Your RefBase Account ‚Üî RefBase Web App
     ‚Üë                                      ‚Üë
   AI Chat                            Your Projects & Data
```

**Think of it like this**: 
- You're talking to AI in your IDE (like having a conversation)
- The MCP server is like a smart secretary listening to everything
- It automatically files important conversations into your RefBase account
- Next time you need help, it can remind AI what worked before

## Your RefBase Setup (Perfect for MCP!)

### ‚úÖ What's Already Great About Your RefBase:
After reviewing your code and database, **your RefBase is perfectly set up** for MCP integration:

1. **User Accounts**: Already has secure user authentication
2. **Multiple Projects**: Each user can have many projects (perfect!)
3. **Feature System**: Your features can store chat conversations
4. **Database Structure**: Supabase works great with external APIs
5. **Chat History Tab**: Already designed to handle AI conversations

### üéØ Key Compatibility Points:

**Your Database Structure**:
- ‚úÖ `projects` table with `user_id` - MCP can access user's projects
- ‚úÖ `features` table linked to projects - Perfect place for AI conversations
- ‚úÖ `feature_data` table for storing different file types including 'chat_history'
- ‚úÖ Supabase authentication - Works with external MCP server
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates - Changes sync automatically

**Your Current Features**:
- ‚úÖ Chat History tab in Features - MCP can save here
- ‚úÖ AI Summary tab - MCP can generate summaries
- ‚úÖ Project workspace structure - MCP knows where to put things
- ‚úÖ File organization system - Conversations can be organized

## How MCP Determines Which Project (Smart Detection)

### The Challenge: 
"How does MCP know which RefBase project I'm working on when I ask AI a question?"

### The Solution (3 Smart Methods):

#### Method 1: Folder Detection (Automatic)
```
Your computer folder: /Users/john/my-ecommerce-app/
MCP looks for: RefBase project named "my-ecommerce-app"
Result: Automatically saves to the right project!
```

#### Method 2: Git Repository Detection (Super Smart)
```
Your IDE is in a git repo
MCP reads the repo name/URL
Matches it to a RefBase project
Result: Perfect match every time!
```

#### Method 3: Manual Selection (When Needed)
```
MCP: "Which RefBase project is this for?"
You: "My E-commerce App"
MCP: "Got it! Saving all conversations there."
Result: You stay in control
```

#### Method 4: Context Learning (Gets Smarter)
```
You often work on "Todo App" in folder /projects/todo/
MCP learns this pattern
Next time: Automatically knows it's the Todo App
Result: Less interruptions, more coding
```

## What Data Can Be Saved & Pulled

### üì• Data MCP Can SAVE to RefBase:

#### 1. **AI Conversations** (The Main Thing)
**What**: Your entire chat with Claude/ChatGPT
**Where**: Saved as chat files in your Feature's Chat History tab
**Format**: Exactly like when you paste conversations now, but automatic

**Example**:
```
Project: "My Todo App"
Feature: "User Authentication" 
New Chat File: "2024-01-15_auth_implementation.md"
Content: Full AI conversation about implementing login
```

#### 2. **Code Snippets** (Super Useful)
**What**: Working code from AI responses
**Where**: Separate files or highlighted in conversations  
**Format**: With syntax highlighting and context

**Example**:
```
Code Block: React Login Component
Language: TypeScript
Context: "This worked perfectly for JWT authentication"
Success Rate: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (you can rate it)
```

#### 3. **Implementation Steps** (Task Tracking)
**What**: AI's suggestions broken into checkboxes
**Where**: Your Tasks tab, linked to the conversation
**Format**: Interactive checklist you can check off

**Example**:
```
From AI Conversation: "How to add dark mode"
Auto-created Task: "Implement Dark Mode"
Steps:
‚ñ° Install dark mode library
‚ñ° Create theme context
‚ñ° Add toggle button
‚ñ° Test in different components
‚úÖ Update color variables (done!)
```

#### 4. **Error Solutions** (Problem Library)
**What**: Errors you encountered and how AI helped fix them
**Where**: Your Bugs tab, linked to solution conversations
**Format**: Error + Working Solution pairs

**Example**:
```
Bug: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
Solution: Add null check before mapping
Chat: Link to conversation where AI provided the fix
Status: Fixed ‚úÖ
```

#### 5. **Project Context** (Smart Memory)
**What**: Info about what you're building
**Where**: Project metadata and feature descriptions
**Format**: Structured project information

**Example**:
```
Project: E-commerce App
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, MongoDB (detected from conversations)
Current Focus: Payment integration (from recent chats)
Common Issues: CORS problems (AI should remember this)
```

### üì§ Data MCP Can PULL from RefBase:

#### 1. **Previous Solutions** (Your Personal Stack Overflow)
**When**: You ask AI about something you've done before
**What MCP Does**: Finds similar past conversations and tells AI
**Result**: AI gives better answers based on what worked for YOU

**Example**:
```
You ask: "How do I add authentication to React?"
MCP finds: Your previous auth conversation from 2 months ago
MCP tells AI: "This user successfully implemented JWT auth using..."
AI responds: More relevant, personalized solution
```

#### 2. **Project-Specific Context** (Smart Continuity)
**When**: You start working on a project
**What MCP Does**: Tells AI about your project setup, recent changes
**Result**: AI understands your project without explanation

**Example**:
```
You ask: "How do I add a new API endpoint?"
MCP provides AI: 
- "This is a Node.js/Express project"
- "User already has auth middleware set up"
- "Recent conversations show they're using MongoDB"
- "They prefer async/await syntax"
AI responds: Perfect endpoint code that fits your existing setup
```

#### 3. **Success Patterns** (What Works for You)
**When**: You're implementing something new
**What MCP Does**: Shares patterns from your successful implementations
**Result**: AI suggests approaches that work with your coding style

#### 4. **Common Mistakes to Avoid** (Learn from Past)
**When**: You're about to make a mistake you've made before
**What MCP Does**: Warns AI about what didn't work previously
**Result**: AI steers you away from known problematic approaches

## User Authentication Flow (How You Connect)

### Step 1: One-Time Setup
1. **Get Your RefBase API Key** (from your RefBase account settings)
2. **Install MCP Server** (simple npm install)
3. **Configure Connection** (paste your API key)
4. **Test Connection** (MCP says "Connected to RefBase!")

### Step 2: Daily Usage (Automatic)
1. **Open your IDE** (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
2. **MCP automatically connects** to your RefBase account
3. **Start coding and asking AI questions** as normal
4. **MCP works in background** saving useful conversations

### Security (How Your Data Stays Safe)
- ‚úÖ **API Key Authentication**: Only you can access your data
- ‚úÖ **Encrypted Connection**: All data transfer is secure
- ‚úÖ **No Password Storage**: MCP never sees your RefBase password
- ‚úÖ **User Control**: You can turn off MCP anytime
- ‚úÖ **Data Ownership**: Your conversations stay in YOUR RefBase account

## Complete User Experience Walkthrough

### Scenario: "I want to add a shopping cart to my e-commerce app"

#### Traditional Way (Frustrating):
1. Ask AI: "How do I implement a shopping cart?"
2. AI gives generic answer
3. Spend time explaining your setup
4. Get working solution but forget to save it
5. Next month: Ask same question again üò§

#### With RefBase MCP (Magical):
1. **Ask AI**: "How do I implement a shopping cart?"
2. **MCP automatically**:
   - Detects you're in "ecommerce-app" folder
   - Tells AI about your React/Node.js setup
   - Mentions you're using Redux for state (from previous chats)
   - Notes you prefer TypeScript (from your patterns)
3. **AI responds** with perfect, personalized solution
4. **MCP automatically**:
   - Saves conversation to "E-commerce App" project
   - Creates it as a new feature "Shopping Cart Implementation"
   - Extracts code snippets for reuse
   - Adds implementation steps to your tasks
5. **Next time** you ask about similar features, AI already knows your preferences!

## Database Changes Needed (Minor Adjustments)

### Current RefBase Database: 95% Ready! ‚úÖ

Your existing database structure is excellent for MCP. Here are small additions needed:

#### 1. Add MCP-Specific Fields (Optional)
```sql
-- Add to existing tables (optional fields)
ALTER TABLE features ADD COLUMN mcp_imported BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE feature_data ADD COLUMN conversation_metadata JSONB;
```

#### 2. Create New Tables for Advanced Features
```sql
-- For tracking conversation success rates
CREATE TABLE conversation_ratings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  feature_data_id UUID REFERENCES feature_data(id),
  success_rating INTEGER, -- 1-5 stars
  user_notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- For storing reusable code patterns
CREATE TABLE code_patterns (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
  name TEXT,
  code_snippet TEXT,
  language TEXT,
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  success_rate DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Good News**: These are additions, not changes. Your existing RefBase keeps working perfectly!

## Data Flow Examples (Real Scenarios)

### Example 1: Authentication Implementation

#### The Setup:
- **Project**: "My SaaS App" 
- **Current Feature**: "User Management"
- **You're working in**: `/code/my-saas/src/auth/`

#### The Conversation:
```
You: "I need to implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens"

MCP (behind the scenes):
1. Detects project: "My SaaS App"
2. Checks RefBase: Finds previous auth discussions
3. Tells AI: "User has React/Node.js setup, uses axios for API calls"

AI: "Perfect! Based on your setup with axios, here's a JWT implementation..."

MCP (automatically):
1. Saves full conversation to "My SaaS App" > "User Management" > Chat History
2. Creates new task: "Implement JWT Authentication" 
3. Extracts 6 implementation steps as subtasks
4. Saves code snippets to reusable pattern library
```

#### The Result in RefBase:
- ‚úÖ New chat file: `2024-01-15_jwt_authentication.md`
- ‚úÖ New task with 6 steps in Kanban board
- ‚úÖ Code patterns saved for future reuse
- ‚úÖ Project context updated with "JWT auth implemented"

### Example 2: Bug Fixing Session

#### The Setup:
- **Error**: "CORS policy blocking my API calls"
- **You've seen this before** but forgot the solution

#### The Conversation:
```
You: "I'm getting CORS errors when calling my API from localhost"

MCP (behind the scenes):
1. Searches RefBase: Finds previous CORS conversation
2. Tells AI: "User fixed this before with specific Express CORS config"
3. Provides the exact solution that worked

AI: "You solved this exact issue before! Here's your working CORS configuration..."

MCP (automatically):
1. Links this conversation to previous CORS solution
2. Updates the bug entry with "resolved again"
3. Marks the solution pattern as "highly effective"
```

#### The Result:
- ‚úÖ Instant solution instead of 30 minutes of debugging
- ‚úÖ Pattern marked as "proven solution"
- ‚úÖ Future CORS issues will be solved even faster

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### What Data is Shared:
- ‚úÖ **AI Conversations**: Only ones you have with programming questions
- ‚úÖ **Code Snippets**: Only code that you're already discussing with AI
- ‚úÖ **Project Names**: Only basic project information
- ‚ùå **Source Code**: MCP doesn't read your actual project files
- ‚ùå **Sensitive Data**: No passwords, API keys, or personal info

### Data Security:
- üîí **Encrypted Transfer**: All data sent over secure connections
- üîí **Your Account Only**: MCP only accesses YOUR RefBase account
- üîí **No Data Storage**: MCP server doesn't store your conversations
- üîí **Revocable Access**: You can disconnect MCP anytime

### Privacy Controls:
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Conversation Filtering**: Choose which conversations to save
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Selection**: Control which projects MCP can access
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Auto-Save Toggle**: Turn automatic saving on/off
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Manual Review**: Review before saving sensitive conversations

## Cross-Project Intelligence (The Game Changer) üöÄ

### The Revolutionary Concept: Read Many ‚Üí Write One

**The Genius**: MCP reads from ALL your projects for knowledge but only writes to your CURRENT project for organization.

#### How It Works:
```
You ask: "How do I add user authentication?"

MCP searches ALL your RefBase projects:
üìñ READ: "Todo App" - JWT implementation (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê worked perfectly)
üìñ READ: "Blog Platform" - Social login integration (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ had CORS issues)
üìñ READ: "Admin Dashboard" - Role-based permissions (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ good pattern)

MCP tells AI: "Based on your 3 previous auth implementations, here's what worked..."
‚úçÔ∏è WRITE: Only saves new conversation to current "E-commerce App" project
```

### Real-World Magic Example:

#### Scenario: Building Payment System for New Project

```
You: "I need to integrate payments in my new app"

Cross-Project Intelligence:
üîç MCP finds: Previous e-commerce project used Stripe successfully
üîç MCP finds: Subscription app had issues with webhook handling  
üîç MCP finds: Your preferred error handling patterns across projects

AI gets context:
"User successfully integrated Stripe in previous e-commerce project.
Code worked: [exact implementation]
Common issue avoided: webhook endpoint security (user solved this before)
Preferred pattern: async/await with try-catch blocks"

AI responds: "Perfect! Based on your successful Stripe integration, here's the same approach adapted for your current project..."

Result: 
‚úÖ Instant expertise from ALL your previous work
‚úÖ Avoid repeating the webhook security mistake  
‚úÖ New conversation only saved to current project
‚úÖ Clean, organized project structure maintained
```

### Advanced Cross-Project Features:

#### 1. **Success Pattern Recognition**
```
MCP tracks what works across projects:
"React + TypeScript setup" ‚Üí Used 5 projects ‚Üí 100% success rate ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"MongoDB connection pattern" ‚Üí Used 3 projects ‚Üí 95% success rate ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
"Custom CSS approach" ‚Üí Used 2 projects ‚Üí 60% success rate ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ
```

#### 2. **Evolution Tracking**
```
MCP: "Your authentication approach has evolved:
2023: Basic email/password (Todo App)
2024: Added social login (Blog Platform)  
2024: Added 2FA (Banking App)
Suggestion: Consider this evolution for your new project"
```

#### 3. **Context-Aware Suggestions**
```
MCP detects: You're building another e-commerce app
MCP suggests: "Your previous e-commerce project had great success with:
- Product search with Elasticsearch
- Shopping cart with Redux Toolkit  
- Payment processing with Stripe
Should I include these proven patterns?"
```

#### 4. **Anti-Pattern Prevention**
```
MCP: "Warning: In your Blog Platform, this API structure caused performance issues.
Here's the improved version from your Admin Dashboard that solved it..."
```

### Technical Implementation:

#### New MCP Tools for Cross-Project Intelligence:

##### 1. **search_all_projects** (READ ONLY)
```typescript
{
  name: "search_all_projects",
  description: "Search across ALL user projects for relevant implementations",
  parameters: {
    query: "user authentication",
    includeSuccessRating: true,
    excludeFailedAttempts: false,
    maxResults: 10
  },
  returns: {
    relevantImplementations: [
      {
        projectName: "Todo App",
        featureName: "User Auth",
        implementation: "JWT + refresh tokens",

      }
    ],
    suggestedApproach: "Based on patterns, JWT + refresh tokens works best for you",
    warningsToAvoid: ["Avoid storing tokens in localStorage (caused security issues in Blog Platform)"]
  }
}
```

##### 2. **get_evolution_pattern**
```typescript
{
  name: "get_evolution_pattern", 
  description: "Show how user's approach to a feature has evolved across projects",

    evolutionTimeline: [
      { project: "Todo App", date: "2023-06", approach: "Basic JWT", success: 4 },
      { project: "Blog Platform", date: "2024-01", approach: "JWT + Social Login", success: 3 },
      { project: "Admin Dashboard", date: "2024-06", approach: "JWT + RBAC + 2FA", success: 5 }
    ],
    recommendedNext: "Consider adding OAuth2 + JWT for enterprise-grade security",
    trendAnalysis: "User is moving toward more secure, feature-rich auth systems"
  }
}
```

##### 3. **save_with_cross_references** (WRITE TO CURRENT ONLY)
```typescript
{
  name: "save_with_cross_references",
  description: "Save conversation to current project with references to source knowledge",
  parameters: {
    conversation: "full AI chat",
    currentProjectId: "auto-detected",
    referencedImplementations: [
      { projectName: "Todo App", featureName: "User Auth", contribution: "JWT implementation pattern" },
      { projectName: "Blog Platform", featureName: "Social Login", contribution: "OAuth integration lessons" }
    ]
  },
  result: "Saves ONLY to current project but credits knowledge sources"
}
```

### Database Queries for Cross-Project Intelligence:

#### Search Across All Projects (READ):
```sql
-- Find relevant implementations across ALL user projects
SELECT 
  p.name as project_name,
  f.title as feature_name,
  f.content,
  fd.content as chat_history,
  fd.metadata->>'success_rating' as success_rating,
  f.updated_at
FROM projects p
JOIN features f ON p.id = f.project_id  
JOIN feature_data fd ON f.id = fd.feature_id
WHERE p.user_id = $user_id 
  AND fd.data_type = 'chat_history'
  AND (
    f.title ILIKE '%authentication%' 
    OR f.content ILIKE '%jwt%'
    OR fd.content ILIKE '%login%'
  )
ORDER BY 
  CAST(fd.metadata->>'success_rating' AS INTEGER) DESC NULLS LAST,
  f.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Save to Current Project Only (WRITE):
```sql  
-- Save new conversation to current project with cross-references
INSERT INTO feature_data (
  feature_id, 
  name, 
  content, 
  data_type,
  metadata
) VALUES (
  $current_project_feature_id,
  $conversation_filename,
  $conversation_content,
  'chat_history',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'cross_project_references', $referenced_projects,
    'knowledge_sources', $source_implementations,
    'created_via_mcp', true,
    'creation_date', now()
  )
);
```

### User Experience Examples:

#### Example 1: Authentication Implementation
```
Working on: "E-commerce App V2"
You ask: "How should I handle user authentication?"

Cross-Project Search Results:
üìö Todo App (2023): "JWT + bcrypt" ‚Üí Success: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
üìö Blog Platform (2024): "JWT + OAuth" ‚Üí Success: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (CORS issues noted)
üìö Admin Dashboard (2024): "JWT + RBAC" ‚Üí Success: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

MCP tells AI: "User has successful JWT pattern. Avoid OAuth CORS issues from Blog Platform. Consider RBAC from Admin Dashboard."

AI Response: "Based on your proven JWT implementation from Todo App and the RBAC success from Admin Dashboard, here's the perfect auth system for your e-commerce app..."

Saved to: E-commerce App V2 > User Management > "auth_implementation_2024.md"
References: Credits Todo App and Admin Dashboard approaches
```

#### Example 2: Payment Processing  
```
Working on: "SaaS Platform"  
You ask: "What's the best way to handle subscription payments?"

Cross-Project Search:
üìö E-commerce App: "Stripe one-time payments" ‚Üí Success: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
üìö Freelance Platform: "Stripe subscriptions" ‚Üí Success: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (webhook issues resolved)

MCP Context: "User successfully implemented Stripe. Previous subscription work solved webhook security. Here's the exact working code..."

Result: Skip the research phase, go straight to proven implementation adapted for SaaS
```

## üö® CRITICAL BUG FIX (August 31, 2025) - API Authentication Issue

### The Problem
The RefBase MCP API was rejecting all API key authentication attempts with error: **"Invalid or inactive API key"**

**Impact**: All MCP server tools were failing with authentication errors, completely blocking MCP integration.

### Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the API code and database migrations, the issue was identified as a **salt consistency problem** between the database hash function and server-side fallback code:

**Database function** (in migrations):
```sql
SELECT md5(key_text || 'refbase_api_salt_' || current_database());
```

**Server-side fallback** (in netlify/functions/api.ts):
```javascript 
crypto.createHash('md5').update(apiKey + 'refbase_api_salt_postgres').digest('hex');
```

**The Mismatch**: 
- Database function used `current_database()` which returns the actual Supabase database name
- Server fallback used hardcoded `'postgres'`
- This created different hashes for the same API key, causing authentication to always fail

### The Fix Applied
Created migration `20250831000000_fix_salt_consistency_final.sql` to standardize the salt format:

```sql
-- Updated hash function to use hardcoded 'postgres' salt matching server code
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION hash_api_key(key_text text)
RETURNS text
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY INVOKER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
  SELECT md5(key_text || 'refbase_api_salt_postgres');
$$;
```

### Resolution Steps
1. **Identified the problem**: Salt mismatch between database and server hashing
2. **Created migration**: Fixed hash function to use consistent salt format
3. **Deployed changes**: Applied migration to production database
4. **Generated new API key**: `refb_8fd5e1f846be29d1103301c0a965561f`
5. **Verified fix**: Comprehensive API testing confirmed authentication working

### Test Results ‚úÖ
After applying the fix, all API endpoints now authenticate successfully:

```bash
# Before Fix
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer refb_5b25c777371143a777794674880c5e1d" https://refbase.dev/api/conversations
# Result: {"success":false,"error":"Invalid or inactive API key"}

# After Fix  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer refb_8fd5e1f846be29d1103301c0a965561f" https://refbase.dev/api/conversations
# Result: {"success":true,"data":[...]} ‚úÖ
```

**All endpoints verified working**:
- ‚úÖ GET /api/conversations - Returns conversation data
- ‚úÖ GET /api/bugs - Returns bug data  
- ‚úÖ GET /api/features - Returns feature data
- ‚úÖ GET /api/documents - Returns document data

### Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**RefBase MCP API is now production-ready** for MCP server integration. The authentication system is working correctly and MCP tools can now successfully connect to RefBase.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Salt consistency is critical** for authentication systems
2. **Database functions and server code must use identical hashing logic**
3. **Always test with fresh API keys** after authentication fixes
4. **Old API keys may need regeneration** after hash function changes
