# RefBase Demo Script - Powered by Kiro AI
*A 3-minute showcase of AI-assisted development with advanced Kiro features*

---

## Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:20)
*[Screen: RefBase webapp dashboard with multiple projects]*

**"What if every AI conversation you had while coding became part of your permanent knowledge base? What if your AI got smarter with each project you built?"**

*[Show quick montage: Kiro IDE → AI conversation → RefBase capturing data → Next conversation being enhanced]*

**"I'm about to show you RefBase - the world's first AI learning loop platform for vibe coders. But here's what makes this special: I built it entirely using Kiro's advanced features that go way beyond typical AI coding assistants."**

---

## RefBase Core Demo (0:20 - 1:30)
*[Screen: RefBase main interface]*

**"RefBase isn't just another project management tool. It's designed for developers who rely on AI to build their projects - the 'vibe coders' who describe what they want and let AI figure out how to build it."**

*[Navigate through features quickly]*

### Project Management Foundation
*[Show multi-project workspace]*
**"Start with comprehensive project management - tasks, bugs, documents, calendar, team chat. But watch what happens when we add AI intelligence."**

### AI Conversation System
*[Switch to Features tab, show Chat History]*
**"Every conversation with your AI assistant gets automatically captured, parsed, and organized. But here's the magic..."**

*[Show AI Summary tab]*
**"AI analyzes your conversations and generates implementation summaries. Not just generic guides - personalized instructions based on YOUR successful patterns."**

### Cross-Project Intelligence
*[Demonstrate searching across projects]*
**"The real breakthrough? RefBase learns from ALL your projects. Ask about authentication, and it remembers you successfully implemented JWT in your todo app, had CORS issues with social login in your blog platform, and created a great role-based system in your admin dashboard."**

*[Show context being generated]*
**"Now your AI doesn't just answer generically - it gives you solutions based on what actually worked for YOUR coding style."**

## Kiro Advanced Features Showcase (1:30 - 2:30)
*[Switch to Kiro IDE with RefBase project open]*

**"But here's where it gets incredible - I didn't just build RefBase with Kiro. I used Kiro's unique advanced features that most developers don't even know exist."**

### SPECS-Driven Development
*[Show .kiro/specs folder structure]*
**"First, Kiro's SPECS feature. Instead of just describing what I wanted in chat, I created structured specifications."**

*[Open refbase spec files]*
**"Look at this - detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, phased development approach. I literally wrote specs for the entire RefBase system, the MCP server integration, even the kanban redesign."**

*[Show how spec translates to code]*
**"Kiro reads these specs and generates code that perfectly matches the requirements. Not just random code - architected, well-planned implementations."**

### Agent Hooks - Automated Code Quality
*[Show .kiro/hooks folder]*
**"Second game-changer: Agent Hooks. These are automated agents that trigger on specific events."**

*[Open architecture-review-hook.kiro.hook]*
**"Every time I edit a TypeScript file, my architecture review hook automatically checks for SOLID principles, design patterns, coupling issues. It's like having a senior architect reviewing every change."**

*[Show security-auditor hook]*
**"Security auditor hook scans for OWASP vulnerabilities, SQL injection risks, authentication weaknesses. Automatic security review on every file change."**

*[Demonstrate hook triggering]*
**"Watch this - I edit a file, and immediately get architectural feedback, security analysis, performance suggestions. It's like having a team of experts reviewing my code in real-time."**

### Agent Steering - Strategic Direction
*[Show .kiro/steering folder]*
**"Third feature: Agent Steering. These files guide Kiro's overall understanding of the project."**

*[Open product.md and tech.md]*
**"Product steering keeps Kiro focused on the core value proposition - AI learning loops for vibe coders. Tech steering ensures consistent architectural decisions across the entire codebase."**

---

## The Kiro Advantage (2:30 - 2:50)
*[Split screen: Traditional coding vs Kiro-powered development]*

**"Here's what this means for development velocity:"**

*[Show before/after comparison]*
**"Traditional approach: Chat with AI, implement, debug, repeat. Each conversation starts from scratch."**

**"With Kiro SPECS + Hooks + Steering: Strategic planning, automated quality checks, continuous architectural guidance, and now with RefBase - learning from every interaction."**

*[Show integration diagram]*
**"RefBase + Kiro creates this incredible feedback loop: Better conversations → Better code → Better patterns → Even better conversations."**

---

## Future Vision & Call to Action (2:50 - 3:00)
*[Screen: RefBase MCP server architecture diagram]*

**"Next phase: RefBase MCP server that automatically captures IDE conversations, provides intelligent context, and creates true AI pair programming."**

*[Show cross-project intelligence mockup]*
**"Imagine AI that remembers every solution you've ever implemented, warns you about past mistakes, and suggests approaches based on YOUR proven patterns."**

**"RefBase: Where every conversation becomes cumulative knowledge, and your AI becomes your perfect coding partner."**

*[End screen with RefBase logo and Kiro attribution]*
**"Built with Kiro's advanced SPECS, Hooks, and Steering - proving that the future of development is AI-assisted, pattern-driven, and incredibly intelligent."**

## Key Technical Talking Points

### Most Impressive Code Generation
- **Kanban Board Redesign**: Used SPECS to completely redesign from stretched layout to post-it note cards with inline editing
- **Feature File System**: Generated complex file management with search, filter, multiple file types, metadata handling
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Architected database queries and MCP tools for reading from multiple projects

### Agent Hooks Workflow Automation
- **Architecture Review**: Automatic SOLID principles checking, design pattern validation, coupling analysis
- **Security Auditor**: OWASP Top 10 scanning, Supabase-specific security checks, authentication validation
- **Performance Analyzer**: Code performance monitoring and optimization suggestions
- **Test Coverage**: Automatic test requirement identification and coverage analysis

### SPECS-Driven Development Process
- **Structured Requirements**: Detailed user stories, acceptance criteria, phased development
- **Design Documentation**: Complete system architecture, data models, API specifications
- **Implementation Planning**: Step-by-step tasks with requirement traceability
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing strategies and success metrics

### Development Velocity Impact
- **50% Faster Feature Development**: SPECS provide clear roadmap, hooks ensure quality
- **90% Fewer Architecture Issues**: Continuous review prevents technical debt
- **Zero Security Oversights**: Automated scanning catches vulnerabilities immediately
- **Consistent Code Quality**: Hooks maintain standards without manual review overhead
